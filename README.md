Sharing wisdom:

- Qs to ask
  - 1.  What the culture is like: environment, management styles, methodologies (agile, etc.), business politics, dress codes
  - 2.  Interviewer's opinion of the company, why they stay / stick around, what they would change
  - 3.  scope of growth / personal development opportunities: horizontal, vertical how often they engage in new technologies
  - 4.  their initial impression of me, qualities visible in other candidates and not me (hard to ask and sometimes even harder to hear the answer)
- Usually ask about 6-7 questions. The above are the ones to ask all the time.
- The others depend on the job, tech stack, tasks, etc.
- An interview is a great way to market yourself but it's also an opportunity for the company to market themselves
- Possible to decline offers from bad interviews
- You just gotta remember that you're not just looking for a job, you're looking for a home away from home.
- Maybe not your first job, but that should become your mentality
